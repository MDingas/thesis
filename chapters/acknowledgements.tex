\chapter{Acknowledgements}

    I would like to firstly thank my advisor, professor Pedro Nuno Sousa, who was always present in any moment I struggled and required input to improve on my work.

    I would also like to thank my family for financially and emotionally supporting me through my academic journey, the friends I've made along the way that made me see the best in people, and last but not least my dog Oscar who showed me unconditional love like only a dog could.

    I finally also thank you, the reader - as a work unused is no work at all, may you find some value in it.
